General comments on style/SQA:

1. No tabs! Remove them from your editor. Better yet, use eclipse and follow
   the xml style.

2. Use underscores for private data, e.g., const double thePrivateData_;

3. Use camel case for data members and classes unless it is silly 
   (you know what I mean).

4. Camel case on Class names always; non camel case for methods, e.g.,

const double Realm::get_me() {
  return hereIAm_; // hmmm... silly? your call
}

5. There is no rush to push! We only support production tested capability.
   Better yet, peform code verification and unit testing.

6. Always run the full regression test suite. No exceptions.

7. Peer review when fully appropriate (ask for a pull request).

8. Use const when possible, however, do not try to be a member of the const police
force. 

9. We need logic to launch some special physics. Try to avoid run time logic
   by designing with polymorphic/templates.

10. When possible, add classes that manage loading, field registration, setup
    and execute, e.g., SolutionNormPostProcessing, etc.

11. Did I mention no pushes without proper testing:)
